# Animaps

This project was created using React, Node, Express, Knex, ReactLeaflet, Tachyons, and PostgreSQL. Deployed on gh Pages and Render. 

### Idea and Functionality

It's a community-oriented application on which users can find spots for animal watching by exploring the map or using the search bar, and add their own locations to the database.

### Lessons Learned

* How to build and deploy a full-stack application from scratch.
* How to integrate OpenStreetMaps using ReactLeaflet. 
* How to use GET and POST HTTP requests in conjunction to insert and retrieve data from a database.
* How to work with ChatGPT.

### Room for Improvement

Besides better styling, the app could have an Edit feature (using PUT method) to update information about a spot, or to fix inaccuracies, for example.
It would be nice, as well, if the app could automatically identify the user's location and update the map accordingly.
