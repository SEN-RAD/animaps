# Animaps

This project was created using React, Node, Express, Tachyons, and PostgreSQL. 

## Idea

My girlfriend loves animals and asked me if I could build an app to record all the places where we've seen them, which could then be shared with others. I said: 'I sure can try!'. This is the result :D I was largely influenced by this website: https://calisthenics-parks.com/. The idea is to make it like that, but with animals, instead of calisthenics parks. 

### Functionality

The user can use the map or search bar to find spots for animal/wildlife watching, or use the Add spot section to add his own spots. 

### Lessons Learned

* How to build a full-stack app from scratch.
* How to integrate OpenStreetMaps using ReactLeaflet. 
* How to use GET and POST HTTP methods in conjunction. 
* How to use chatGPT to assist me in my coding.

### Room for Improvement

Besides better styling, the app could have an Edit feature (using PUT method) to update information about a spot, or to fix inaccuracies, for example.
It would be nice, as well, if the app could automatically identify the user's location and update the map accordingly.
