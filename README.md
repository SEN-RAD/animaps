# Animaps

This project was created using React, Node, Express, Knex, ReactLeaflet, Tachyons, and PostgreSQL. Deployed on gh Pages and Render. 

### Idea and Functionality

Users can explore the map or use the search bar to find spots for animal watching, click on the map markers to find more information about the location, and contribute to the database by adding their own spots.

Want to test it?

1. Explore the functionality in the homepage (map, search bar, markers)
2. Click on Add a spot, fill in the form and click Send. 
3. Go back to the homepage, you will see your spot added to the map. 

### Lessons Learned

* How to build and deploy a full-stack application using React, Node and PSQL. 
* How to use ReactLeaflet to integrate OpenStreetMaps. 
* How to use GET and POST HTTP requests in conjunction to insert and retrieve data from a database.
* How to work with ChatGPT.

### Room for Improvement

At the moment, users cannot upload images, because I haven't figured out how to uploead them to the database. This needs to be solved. Then, besides better styling, the app should have Register and sign-in functions, an Edit feature (using PUT method) to update information about a spot, and it would be nice, if the app could automatically identify a new user's location and render the map accordingly.
