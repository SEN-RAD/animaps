* How to integrate maps from OpenStreetMaps using React leaflet.

## Room for Improvement üîß

* When searching a keyword that is obviously an animal name (e.g. dogs) but that is not in the database, the app should respond with a message saying that it is not in the database, instead of responding with a location on the map with that name (yes, there are locations called "dogs").
* Image upload function in the Add Spot (not working at the moment).
* Register and sign-in functions, so only registered users are able to add contribute.
* PUT and POST endpoints to edit spots and add comments.
* Automatic identification of a new user's location and setting of updatedStartLocation accordingly.
